# Analysis on sexual crimes  database from  Colombia 

In this project I analyze the database of sexual crimes in Colombia in the years between 2010 and 2020. This database was provided by  [DIJIN - National Police(Data extracted on June 14, 2021 at 18:00)](https://www.datos.gov.co/Seguridad-y-Defensa/Reporte-Delitos-sexuales-Polic-a-Nacional/fpe5-yrmw) 



First the data is partially cleaned and prepared in SQL. The database is exported and worked on Python where libraries as pandas, matplotlib and seaborn are used to make an Exploratory Data Analysis and take a better understanding on the state of sexual crimes in the country.
